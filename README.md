# 🤖 Shouqa's Robot Control System 🚀
An interactive system for controlling a robot's movements using a web-based interface. This project combines frontend, backend, and interactive design techniques to provide a seamless robotics control experience with a stylish user interface.

## ✨ Features
- 🕹️ Interactive Control Panel: Allows issuing commands such as Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop using a web interface.
- 🎨 Stylized UI: A visually engaging UI with a modern look and a pixel-art-inspired design.
- 🖥️ Responsive Design: The interface adjusts based on the device to ensure an optimal experience on any screen size.
- ⚙️ Command Feedback: Displays the most recent command sent to the robot, showing which direction is currently active.
- 🛠️ CSS Elliptical Layout: The control panel is designed within an elliptical shape to give the UI a modern and visually appealing look.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP (for potential future database integration)
- Design: Custom CSS layout with animation for an engaging user experience.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Control Panel: The control panel presents five buttons: Forward, Left, Stop, Right, and Backward. When any of these buttons are clicked, the corresponding command is sent.
2. Command Display: The system shows the most recent command sent under the "Command Sent" label.
3. CSS Layout: The control panel is positioned in an elliptical shape with each button carefully placed to ensure clear visibility and user interaction.
4. Stylized User Interface: The entire interface uses vibrant colors, smooth animations, and modern UI practices to keep the user engaged.
